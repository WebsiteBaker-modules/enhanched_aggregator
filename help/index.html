	<h2>Aggregator Content</h2>
	<h3>Aggregate “hidden” pages</h3>
		<p>
		This setting forces Aggregator to list child pages that have their visibility set to 'hidden'. If this setting is off, 'hidden' child pages will not appear in your aggregator list.
		</p>
	<h3>Generate thumbnail from first image</h3>
		<p>
		If you turn this setting on, Aggregator will search the contents of every child page for an image. If it finds an image, it will make a thumbnail of it, which it will add to the list. Once this option is switched on, the other options in this section take effect. If this option is off, the other settings are ignored. If no image is found in a child page, no thumbnail is generated.
		</p>
	<h3>Maximum thumbnail size</h3>
		<p>
			This setting is only effective if you've turned on 'Generate Thumbnail from first image'. This specifies the maximum width and height that the thumbnail will be – in pixels. The thumbnail is generated by scaling the original image proportionately.
		</p>
	<h3>Use first image of class</h3>
		<p>
		Usually, if 'Generate thumbnail from first image' is on, Aggregator will accept the first image it finds in the child page, as the 'original' image for its thumbnail. If a class name is entered here, however, Aggregator will look for the first image on the page which also has this class style applied to it. This is useful to force Aggregator to look for a special type of image in your page – not just any first image – which you can specify manually. In order to use this feature, you must:
			<ol>
				<li>use a template that has at least 1 custom class style which you can apply to images</li>
				<li>use a WYSIWYG editor that allows you to apply class styles to image elements – such as the excellent “Xinha”</li>
				<li>enter the class name in this Aggregator setting</li>
				<li>apply the class style to an image on the page</li>
			</ol>
		</p>
		<p>
		The name you enter here must be the class style name, without the leading '.' (dot). So, if the class name is “.specialimage”, you would simply enter here “specialimage”. If no image that has this class style applied is found, no thumbnail is generated.
		</p>
	<h3>Include page title</h3>
		<p>
		If ticked, Aggregator will include in its listings the Page Title of every child page.
		</p>
	<h3>Extract a page summary</h3>
		<p>
		If selected, Aggregator will try to find some information inside the contents of every child page, which it will list as a 'summary' for that page. The other settings in this section only take effect if this is switched on – otherwise, they are ignored.
		</p>
	<h3>Find summary element by tag</h3>
	<p>
	Aggregator will search for the first html element in the content of the child's page, which is of the specified type, and will use it as the summary for that page. This can be used in conjunction with the 'Find element summary by class' setting, to force Aggregator to find an element that is both of a certain type, and a certain class style. This setting is ignored, if 'Extract a page summary' has not been ticked. If no element in found in the child's contents of the specified type, no summary is generated.
	</p>
	<h3>Find summary element by class</h3>
		<p>
		Aggregator will search for the first html element in the content of the child's page, which has the specified style class applied to it, and will use it as the summary for that page. This can be used in conjunction with the 'Find element summary by tag' setting, to force Aggregator to find an element that is both of a certain type, and a certain class style. This setting is ignored, if 'Extract a page summary' has not been ticked. If no element in found in the child's contents of the specified type, no summary is generated.
		</p>
	<h3>Remove HTML from summary</h3>
		<p>
		if the summary element contains other html elements – for instance, horizontal rules, images, tables, bold, etc. - these may disrupt the layout of the Aggregator list. Turning this option on will force Aggregator to remove all html markup from the summary element, leaving only plain text to be displayed.
		</p>
	<h2>Aggregator Layout</h2>
	<h3>Number of lines per page</h3>
		<p>
		Specifies the maximum number of lines your Aggregator list should have per page. The maximum number of items you entire list will have per page will be: lines per page x items per line.
		</p>
	<h3>Number of items per line</h3>
		<p>
		Specifies the maximum number of items per line your aggregator list should have. The maximum number of items you entire list will have per page will be: lines per page x items per line.
		</p>
	<h3>Apply this class to all list items</h3>
		<p>
		You may enter the name – without the leading “.” (dot) – of a css class style that will be applied to every item in the list. Applying a css class style to the items makes it easier for you to customise the appearance of your Aggregator list – by specifying appropriate styles in your template's stylesheet
		</p>
	<h3>Assign this id to this aggregator</h3>
		<p>
		You may enter a unique id that will be given to the Aggregator list. Assigning an id to the Aggregator may help you target and style different Aggregators in your stylesheet.
		</p>
	<h3>Show pages browser at top/bottom</h3>
		<p>
		If your aggregator list will need more than one page, you can display a 'pages browser', to allow visitors to navigate between the pages in the list. The pages browser can be displayed either at the top of the list, at the bottom, or at both ends. If your aggregator list will only ever have 1 page, you may wish to hide the pages browser, by turning both options off.
